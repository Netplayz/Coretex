# Coretex (Nekotina-Clone)

## Overview
Cortex is an open-source Discord bot inspired by the popular **Nekotina** bot.  
The goal is to replicate most of Nekotina’s features and make them accessible to everyone.

> ⚠️ This is an early version with fewer features—the idea is to recreate, not copy it 100%.  
> Economy systems and other features will be added in the future.
